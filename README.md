# Project-U4

Ski Slope Review

Mark Jenquine & Vince Lanzilotti

After agreeing on our project topic and design, we started out by making a new github repository and then the rails server. We made our database, set up with scaffold, ran migrate, then made some test inputs in rails console. Then we made our react app, added proxy in package.json, added cors in gemfile, and ran bundle. We added code in App.js and Main.js, then added our components. Once we were up and running we added css/bootstrap.
